This is an integrated web and Chat GPT AI system to help consumers understand their energy usage and model their historical usage with past and possible future tariffs.  It will also help them analyze decisions to invest in solar panels, batteries, or electric appliances.

The core of the system is your home energy model.  All 8760 hours of the year are recorded for considered for consumption and generation, based energy costs for a given tariff for gas and electric.  You can do "what if" modeling, asking what if you added an array of solar panels on your roof at a certain tilt and sun angle.  Or used a heat pump instead of a gas furnace.  Or charged an EV at midnight instead of bought gasoline for a ICE vehicle.

You can access this through a web page or through the Energy Insight CHAT GPT.

The model is also available through APIs as well.
